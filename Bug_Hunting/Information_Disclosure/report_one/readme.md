After reporting this issue through Trip.com's responsible disclosure program, I was informed that this vulnerability had already been submitted by another researcher and marked as a duplicate. The original report, which I was told about for transparency, had the following details:

- **Title:** firebase credentials and vite_google_api_key exposed store in cleartext of analytics.travix.com  
- **State:** Informative
- **Duplicate Severity:** Medium-5

Even though my submission was a duplicate and marked Informative, I am proud to have identified this issue independently as part of my web security learning journey.
